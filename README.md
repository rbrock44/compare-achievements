## ðŸ§  What's My Purpose?

This is a server side single-page angular frontend created to help compare multiple friends' achievements on different platforms [WIP]. Steam only allows comparison of 1 user at a time and I found the refresh feature to not work as expected

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies

- Framework: `Angular 19`
- Styles: `Tailwind CSS`
- Testing: `Karma`
- Deployment: `GitHub Pages`

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started (Local Setup)

* Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en) - v19 is needed (v22 also works)
* Clone [repo](https://github.com/rbrock44/compare-achievements)
